# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is auto
generated in the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image to
the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

will generate an `.html` page of your report. After deadline for answering this template, we will autoscrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate an `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final handin.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

will check your answers in this template against the constrains listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, have you included an image when asked to.

For both functions to work it is important that you do not rename anything. The script have two dependencies that can
be installed with `pip install click markdown`.

> Answer:

s164397, s221813, s174261, s174250

### Question 3
> **What framework did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

Our project produced an image classifier able to classify rice varieties among Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag. We used a deep learning model. From the third-party framework PyTorch Images we imported a pre-trained ResNet50 model, and a training script. From Kaggle.com we imported the Rice Image Dataset. 

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development enviroment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

We used (mini)conda, pipreqs, docker, and git to manage our dependencies. We created a conda environment to make sure that the dependencies of our project do not cross-contaminate with others. Requirements of both pip and conda were handled by package pipreqs. To get a complete copy of our development environment, one would have to build our docker file: 

docker build -f Docker.dockerfile . -t trainer:latest. 

This file contains requirements.txt and environment.yml (generated wrespectively with commands pipreqs and conda env export > environment.yml). Finally, version control was managed with Git. A new team member would be invited to join the github repository, clone it, and run the docker file. 

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. Did you fill out every folder or only a subset?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
> Answer:

A cookiecutter template is a set of files and directories that are used as a starting point for creating new projects. The template typically includes a variety of different components, such as source code, documentation, and configuration files. Overall, our code is organized into several different directories and files, each with a specific purpose.

The project folder contains any configuration files necessary for the project, such as settings for a specific framework or environment. The data folder is used to store any data related to the project, such as training and validation data and make_dataset.py file.

The models folder is used to store our the imported model. The reports folder is used to store any reports generated by the project, such as performance metrics or analysis results. The src folder contains the source code for the project, including the training script under models/train_model.py

The templates folder is used to store any templates used by the project, such as HTML or LaTeX templates. The test folder is used to store any test cases and test scripts used to test the project. The test folder includes subfolders for unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests.

From the original template we removed the LICENSE file, the notebooks, and references folders as not of interest to our project. We added the config folder. 

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? Additionally, explain with your own words why these**
> **concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Answer:

Rules for code and quality format ensure consistency, maintainability, and readability in large projects. This improves collaboration and reduces errors, ultimately saving time and resources. Our code is formatted to meet Pep8 standards via black editor. Import statements are taken care of with isort. We added docstrings to document some of our files. 

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement?**
>
> Answer:

TO DO

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If you code had an code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> **Answer length: 100-200 words.**
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

No, having a code coverage of 100% does not guarantee that the code is error-free. Code coverage measures the percentage of code that is executed during testing, but it does not take into account the quality of the tests or the correctness of the code logic. Even if all lines of code are executed, there may still be bugs or errors present in the code. Additionally, code coverage does not account for edge cases or unexpected inputs that may cause the code to fail. Therefore, it is important to also conduct thorough testing and code review to ensure the overall quality and reliability of the code. The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. 

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in addition to the main branch. Each branch worked on different taks: one created a dedicated environment for the project to keep track of packages, filled out the requirements.txt file, checked code formatting, setup version control, wrote one configuration file for our experiments, created a data storage in GCP Bucket for our data and linked this with our data version control setup.

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

Yes, initially Google Drive, then GCP bucket, and finally Git Large File System. Although we set up data version control, our dataset was never modified. In general, DVC is beneficial in managing data in a project when multiple team members are working on the same data set. With data version control, team members can collaborate on the dataset and make changes without interfering with each other's work. It also allows for easy tracking of changes and rollbacks if necessary. Additionally, data version control makes it easy to reproduce results and maintain a clear history of changes to the data set, which is essential for transparency and reproducibility in research projects. Overall, data version control ensures efficient collaboration and accountability in data management.

> *For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the*
> *training docker image: `docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64`. Link to docker file: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

In the training phase, Docker is used to create a containerized environment for the training dataset and the training script. This ensures that the training process is consistent and reproducible across different environments. In the inference phase, a containerized environment is created for the trained model and the inference script, which can be deployed to different environments. In the deployment phase, the containerized environment is deployed to a production environment, such as a cloud service or a local server, to ensure that the model is running in a consistent environment. This allows for easy scaling and management of the deployed model.

>
> Answer length: 50-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the following two services: Engine and Bucket. Engine is used for... and Bucket is used for...*
>
> Answer:

Google Cloud Platform's Engine and Bucket are two separate services that work together to provide a comprehensive solution for cloud computing and storage. Engine is a powerful and flexible platform that allows users to create and run virtual machines, containers, and other applications on the cloud. It provides a wide range of features and tools for managing and scaling resources, including automatic load balancing, automatic backups, and automatic scaling. This makes it easy for users to create and manage their applications and services on the cloud, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

Bucket, on the other hand, is a cloud-based storage service that allows users to store and manage data in the cloud. It provides a simple and cost-effective way to store and access data, including large files, images, videos, and other types of data. Bucket also provides a range of security and access controls, so users can control who has access to their data and how it is used. Together, Engine and Bucket provide a powerful and reliable solution for cloud computing and storage, making it easy for users to create and manage their applications and services on the cloud.

### Question 26

> **Discuss the overall struggles of the project. Where did you spend most time and what did you do to overcome these**
> **challenges?**
>
> Answer length: 200-400 words.
>
> Example:
> *The biggest challenges in the project was using ... tool to do ... . The reason for this was ...*
>
> Answer:

One of the main struggles our team faced during the project was managing multiple branches on our git repository. As we progressed through the project, we encountered multiple challenges that required us to create new branches to fix bugs or implement new features. However, this led to confusion and difficulty in merging the branches back into the main branch. To overcome this challenge, we implemented a strict branching strategy where we designated specific team members as branch managers to ensure that merging was done in an organized and timely manner.

Another struggle we faced was installing the necessary tools for the project. The project required us to use several new technologies that we were not familiar with, such as GCP and Weights & Biases. This led to a significant amount of time spent on researching and learning how to use these tools effectively.

Integrating our model into the cookie cutter structure was another challenge we faced. The cookie cutter structure provided a clear and organized file structure for the project, but it was difficult for us to understand how to properly integrate our model into it. This led to a lot of time spent on understanding the structure and determining the best way to integrate our model. To overcome this challenge, we discussed regularly to brainstorm solutions.

Lastly, monitoring was a struggle for us as we spent a lot of time trying to understand how to properly monitor our model's performance and system telemetry. We faced challenges in setting up monitoring tools and interpreting the data they provided. To overcome this challenge.
